# IMDB-Data-Analysis

## Background
This dataset contains 28 variables about 5,043 movies spanning across 100 years in 66 countries. There are 2399 unique director names, and thousands of actors/actresses.I am going to perform exploratory data analysis on this dataset and find some meaningful insights.

## Objective
Our objective is to perform exploratory data analysis and implement machine learning algorithms to find out what factors might contribute to great movies.

## Approach
We apply K-means clustering to segment the movies and then use decision trees to predict which factors contribute to great movies.
